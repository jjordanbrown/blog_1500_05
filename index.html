            <p> In September 2022, designers Leslie Lok and Sasa Zivokvic were approaching the completion of the second floor of the first multi-storey 3D-printed structure in the United States. This article outlines the ways 3D-printing is streamlining the construction process, making it more efficient, producing less waste, and proving to be more cost effective than traditional forms of construction. Not only are the buildings constructed faster, but are structurally solid and leave a wealth of options as far as design goes. The process of integrating 3-D printing into the construction of commercial use buildings also might be available sooner rather than later, looking like a promising window into the future of housing.</p>
