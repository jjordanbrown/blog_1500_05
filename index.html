            <p>It’s nearly the end of the year, so it’s time to specifically talk about what’s on the horizon in technology for 2023.</p>
            <p>Virtual Reality is predicted to make a big impact come 2023. This article talks about the further development of Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse, how more VR headsets will be widely available to more people, from the affordable to the premium from companies like Sony, and Apple.</p>
            <p>It’s not only entertainment that VR aims to make a splash. Applications are being explored to augment remote working experiences, and employee training, and the manufacturing sphere, and beyond. These are just some of the ways that VR is predicted to go in the next year.</p>
            <p>It’s exciting to see where VR is set to go in the coming year.</p>

            <p>Over the course of my research for this article, there is one specific technology that’s popping up in almost every industry for it’s potential to reshape nearly every walk of life; Artificial Intelligence. This articles aim “is to explain AI to an audience of policymakers, opinion leaders, and interested observers, and demonstrate how AI already is altering the world.”</p>
            <p>The way I phrase the beginning was wrong. I made it sound as though AI hasn’t already started being integrated into business practices and daily life. The potential for AI is enormous, and it’s rapid adoption across a variety of different areas like finance, health care, criminal justice, transportation, design, and much more, means it’s probably a good thing to learn about lest of all you’ll know their soft spots when they overthrow us humans and take over the world…ba dum tss.</p>
            <p>I’ll show myself out.</p>

            <figure>Thymia, developed by Emilia Molimpakis, uses video games to collect data about a persons' mental health based on how they interact with their screens</figure>
            <time>NOV. 25, 2022</time>
            <p>A.I. is introducing a wealth of new opportunities for development in many areas, and one of those areas is mental health. Thymia,  an A.I. developed by  Emilia Molimpakis after a personal tragedy, gathers data about how people interact with their screens while playing video games, designed after classic experimental protocols to assess a persons’ mental health. Thymia is one way technology is being used to fill the gap in need for mental health care, along with apps like Sean Kidd’s App4Independence. There are still concerns like breaches in confidentially and selling user data, but there is certainly a large amount of potential for technology to become a valuable tool for mental health practitioners and patients alike. </p>
            <p>I have struggled with mental illness (ADHD gang, and it's comorbid friends). It’s easy to see the gaps in mental health care, like months long wait-lists, objectivity in the diagnostic process, financial limitations that prevent access to adequate care, etc. I want to be clear that I’m not blaming professionals who are giving that care. I’m simply saying the mental health system itself seems ill equipped to handle the demand placed on it, especially in the wake of the pandemic. </p>
            <p>I have reservations about the new role of technology in mental health care, which the article outlines. Due to things like confidentiality and other regulatory factors, I think the idea of technologies’ use in the way this article talks about is still in its infancy. That said, it’s an exciting idea to see the potential AI or apps or something else can help close the gaps in mental health care. I’m interested to see where it goes, and how it will change how mental health care is handled in the future. Many people are affected by mental health struggles, and they deserve care. The idea of help being more ubiquitous is an astounding thought.</p>

            <figure>Scene from Seeing Red, 2022, where Pixar's Presto Crowd Foundations software was first demonstrated</figure>
            <time>NOV. 18, 2022</time>
            <p> Pixar is a studio where art pushes technology. They are no stranger to innovation, developing a software called “Presto” specifically for the studio that would be more intuitive to its animators, and being in-house, would make tweaking the code to serve the needs of a specific project possible. The newest need pushing development at Pixar? </p> <p>Crowds.</p><p>Crowds have posed a challenge to animators for decades, and although Disney and Pixar animators have risen to the challenge, there were still limitations. With this new development, animators can render large aggregate models, giving them individual characteristics, while not losing mass edit capabilities. This means larger crowds with individual attributes without the pain of editing every single one, allowing Pixar to realize their stories closer to how they intended.</p>
            <p>I think for many people, Pixar movies hold a special place. They are the best movies to cozy up with, and no other animation will make you sob the way they do (Ghibli gets close.) I've admired their innovation in storytelling, and creativity, and it's incredible to see it happening behind the scenes. It's cool to see a program like Presto's ongoing development, and how they took it into their own hands to facilitate the animation process while pushing the quality. Through the development of Presto, the creative team can decide the limits of what they can do.</p>

            <figure>A COBOD BOD2 3D construction printer builds structural elements of a Houston home that will be the first multistory 3D-printed structure in the United States.</figure>
            <time>NOV. 11, 2022</time>
            <p> In September 2022, designers Leslie Lok and Sasa Zivokvic were approaching the completion of the second floor of the first multi-storey 3D-printed structure in the United States. This article outlines the ways 3D-printing is streamlining the construction process, making it more efficient, producing less waste, and proving to be more cost effective than traditional forms of construction. Not only are the buildings constructed faster, but are structurally solid and leave a wealth of options as far as design goes. The process of integrating 3-D printing into the construction of commercial use buildings also might be available sooner rather than later, looking like a promising window into the future of housing.</p>
