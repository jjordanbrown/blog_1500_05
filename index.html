            <p> Pixar is a studio where art pushes technology. They are no stranger to innovation, developing a software called “Presto” specifically for the studio that would be more intuitive to its animators, and being in-house, would make tweaking the code to serve the needs of a specific project possible. The newest need pushing development at Pixar? </p> <p>Crowds.</p><p>Crowds have posed a challenge to animators for decades, and although Disney and Pixar animators have risen to the challenge, there were still limitations. With this new development, animators can render large aggregate models, giving them individual characteristics, while not losing mass edit capabilities. This means larger crowds with individual attributes without the pain of editing every single one, allowing Pixar to realize their stories closer to how they intended.</p>
            <p>I think for many people, Pixar movies hold a special place. They are the best movies to cozy up with, and no other animation will make you sob the way they do (Ghibli gets close.) I've admired their innovation in storytelling, and creativity, and it's incredible to see it happening behind the scenes. It's cool to see a program like Presto's ongoing development, and how they took it into their own hands to facilitate the animation process while pushing the quality. Through the development of Presto, the creative team can decide the limits of what they can do.</p>

            <p> In September 2022, designers Leslie Lok and Sasa Zivokvic were approaching the completion of the second floor of the first multi-storey 3D-printed structure in the United States. This article outlines the ways 3D-printing is streamlining the construction process, making it more efficient, producing less waste, and proving to be more cost effective than traditional forms of construction. Not only are the buildings constructed faster, but are structurally solid and leave a wealth of options as far as design goes. The process of integrating 3-D printing into the construction of commercial use buildings also might be available sooner rather than later, looking like a promising window into the future of housing.</p>
